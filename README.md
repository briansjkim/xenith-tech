# What I've learned from this project
 > From this project, I learned the importance of why an MVP should focus on the big picture first before the small picture. Although I had outlines and a structure set before going into this project, there were multiple instances where I had to revert changes because they were too detail-oriented and only applicable in certain components/functions rather than the whole project. Because of this, my workflow wasn't as efficient as it could have been. Additionally, I was able to dive deeper into React, especially with the setState function, propTypes, and accounting for reusable functions and components in order to not repeat code.
# Improvements/Enhancements to this project
 > A big improvement to this project would definitely be making it responsive. When it comes to React itself, there are a few improvements that I had in mind while working on the project. Using Context API is something that would make code readability and data handling a bit easier, and it was something I wanted to use if I had the time after the project was completed. React Hooks is also something that I wanted to use if I had time after completing the project because it doesn't require class components and setting up the constructor and super. When thinking of scaling the code and project, I think React Hooks would have been a better choice than using class and functional components because it would have made data handling and component structure much easier.
